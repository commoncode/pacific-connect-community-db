# The Pacific Connect Community Database

The [Pacific Connect](https://www.icdp.com.au/pacific-connect/) community database provides a
means for participants in Pacific Connect to find details for one another and to maintain their own contact details through a
web portal.

It is being developed as part of the Vanuatu Code Project.
